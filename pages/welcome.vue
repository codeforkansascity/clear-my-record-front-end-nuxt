          The purpose of this interview is to determine whether you might be eligible to have a conviction expunged from your record. An expungement is a civil court proceeding in which a judge determines whether your record should be expunged. If a conviction is expunged, or "erased" from your record, the conviction will be removed from your record permanently and you may be able to, under certain circumstances indicate that you have not previously been convicted of a crime.	Do you understand what an expungement is?
